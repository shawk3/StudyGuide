# StudyGuide
A python notebook study guide for YSOP 2020

There are two notebooks available. The study guide notebook contains instructions and partially written and incomplete code. Your task is to accomplish the tasks set in the instructions. You are welcome to reference the second Jupyter notebook which contains my solutions. Please note that there is often more than one way to solve a problem, so don't feel like you need to solve every problem the same way I do. Though it is probably to your advantage to at least understand how I obtained my solutions.
